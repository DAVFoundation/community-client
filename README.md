It is the place for DAV enthusiasts to:

* Get updates about DAV network
* Discover opportunities to earn DAV using their own autonomous vehicle, or service
* Integrate directly with DAV through the blockchain
* View their DAV account

The community-client project is the frontend part of the [community](https://github.com/DAVFoundation/community) project.

### community-client is currently under heavy construction!

Feel free to **Star** and **Watch** it, but watch out for falling debris.
